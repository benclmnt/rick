# Rick üê∞

Rick is my personal internet navigator.

I use it as my default search engine, which is similar to a normal duckduckgo search but with some powerups, such as
1. Directly do a website search, such as MDN doc search or youtube search
2. Store personal shortcuts for frequently-accessed links

Some powerups are listed [here](https://rick.benclmnt.com/)
